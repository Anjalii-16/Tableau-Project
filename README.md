# E-commerce Sales Dashboard Development using Tableau


# Objective:
The primary objective of this project was to create a comprehensive e-commerce sales
dashboard using Tableau to provide insightful analytics on sales, profit, order quantity, and
market shares. The dashboard aimed to facilitate data-driven decision-making by visualizing
key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends.

# Project Scope:
This project involved processing and analyzing over 1 lakh entries from a CSV file, which contained
detailed sales data across various domains. The dashboard was designed to compare current sales
data with previous year's sales and offer a detailed breakdown of monthly performance.

# Methodology:
1. Data Collection:
• Data Source: Sales data was collected from an extensive CSV file, containing over 1
lakh entries.
• Data Fields: Key fields included date of sale, product category, sales amount, profit,
order quantity, and market segment.

2. Dashboard Design:
• Tool Used: Tableau was selected for its robust visualization capabilities and user-
friendly interface.
• KPIs: Key performance indicators such as total sales, total profit, average order
quantity, and market share percentages were identified.
• Visual Elements:
o Sparklines: To show trends over time.
o Bar Charts: For comparing sales and profit across different categories.
o Line Charts: To track monthly sales performance.
o KPIs: Displayed prominently to provide at-a-glance information.
o Filters: Included to allow users to drill down into specific data points, such as
by month, category, or region.

3. Implementation:
• Data Integration: Imported the transformed data into Tableau.
• Visualization Creation: Developed various charts and graphs to represent the sales
data visually.
• Dashboard Assembly: Combined the visual elements into a cohesive and interactive
dashboard.
• Interactivity: Added filters and tooltips to enhance user experience and allow for
detailed data exploration.

4. Analysis and Insights:
1. Monthly Sales Comparison:
o Displays sales for each month.
o Compares current month sales with the same month in the previous year.
o Shows the percentage change in sales from the previous year.
2. Monthly Profit Analysis:
o Shows profit for each month.
o Compares current month profit with the same month in the previous year.
o Displays the percentage increase or decrease in profit from the previous year.
3. Order Quantity Tracking:
o Shows the number of orders placed each month.
o Compares current month order quantity with the same month in the previous
year.
4. Market Share by Sales:
o Shows market share contributions from different regions: Africa, Europe,
LNTAM, Pacific Asia, and USCA.
o Uses a donut chart to display sales contributions from each region for every
month.

5. Category-wise YTD vs PYTD:
o Compares Year-to-Date (YTD) sales with Previous Year-to-Date (PYTD) sales
across various categories.
o Indicates sales increases, decreases, or new branches added in the current
year.

6. Market-wise Customer Acquisition:
o Tracks customer acquisition per month for regions: Africa, Europe, LNTAM,
Pacific Asia, and USCA.
o Displays a graph showing monthly fluctuations in customer acquisition from
January to December.

# Outcome:
The resulting Tableau dashboard provided a powerful tool for stakeholders to monitor sales
performance, make informed decisions, and identify areas for improvement. The interactive
nature of the dashboard allowed for deep dives into specific data segments, enhancing the
overall analytical capabilities of the team.
Conclusion:
This project successfully leveraged Tableau's visualization strengths to transform raw sales
data into actionable insights. The e-commerce sales dashboard not only facilitated real-time
monitoring but also supported strategic planning and operational efficiency.
